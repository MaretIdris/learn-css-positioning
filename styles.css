/*  Resetting browser default styles:
https://cssreset.com/scripts/html5-doctor-css-reset-stylesheet/#the-scripts

Make sure to edit that list to reset only the elements that are relevant for you!

Another issue is to do with the Cascading part of ‘Cascading Style Sheets’.
If your CSS Reset isn’t carefully written, you might find that your CSS rules
are being themselves overwritten by the code that was supposed to be their
baseline! This is often a problem when using the Universal Selector Reset,
but won’t generally be an issue if working with well-written code such as the
HTML5 Doctor CSS Reset.
